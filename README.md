# Nido

## Introduction
Nido is an electron app customized with config files and the Say npm module to permit text to speech functionality. It is intended to be a means for developers to avoid the command line as needed. They can simply communicate with the dev personal assistant and it will take care of the rest.

## Scope
At this time Nido only supports text to speech functionality and not speech to text as dictation modules aren't fully available yet.

## Pre-Requisites
<ul>
  <li> Custom default.json config file</li>
</ul>

## Usage
There are currently only five supported actions (made into buttons): Launch dev environment, build, test, start app, stop app.
